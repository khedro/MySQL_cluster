To run the automated pipeline, modify the file in ~/.aws/credentials appropriately, then run: bash runPipeline.sh
The outputs are 3 log files + 3 sql files - one from each worker and one from the manager.
In addition, there are 4 benchmark_*.log files for benchmarking each proxy pattern

File structure:
- The setUp*.sh scripts are to be run on their respective instances using paramiko
- the app*.py scripts are the FastAPI applications to be run on the respective instances
- getJsono.py is to be used after all instances are generated to retrieve IPs of said instances by name
- gateKeeper*.py are the scripts used to create the gateKeeper instances and deploy the apps on them
- main.py and fullSetUpProxyManagerWorker.py are used to create the Proxy + Manager + Worker(1/2) instances
and deploy the FastAPI apps on them.
